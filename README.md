# TDK-NeoVim 

It just works and that's it.

**⚠️ Warning**: this configuration works properly, though it should (will) be refactored later. 

To find out more about configuration try `<leader>ft` and check out TODO comments.

Most important key bindings:

- `<leader><leader>` - find and open a file;
- `<C-k>` and `<C-j>` - move up and down through list of options almost everywhere (telescope and autocompletion options);
- `<C-\>` - toggle last opened floating terminal. If you need multiple, use `1<C-\>`, `2<C-\>` etc;
- `<C-h>` (`j`/`k`/`l`) - move between split panes;
- `[d` / `]d` - move through diagnostics;

... and even more keys you can find in configuration. Just look into TODO comments.
